			<h3>Areas of Interest:</h3>
			<p>I am interested in the following areas in Computer Science:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Machine Learning</li>
				<li>Natural Language Processing</li>
				<li>Cybersecurity</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The application of Artificial Intelligence, famously known as
				Machine Learning, has been making its presence felt with its
				ability to learn from data and enhance its performance
				progressively. The potential of this rapidly expanding field is
				tremendous. It is affecting various industries like finance,
				healthcare and transportation, advancing so many technologies.
				The notion of machines being able to comprehend and make
				predictions based on data is a revolutionary concept. It will
				possibly significantly alter the way we function in our daily
				lives.
			</p>
			<p>
				Natural Language Processing, the field that navigates the
				communication between humans and computers through natural
				language, has grown a lot over the past few years. This progress
				has enabled machines to comprehend, analyze and generate human
				language with incredible accuracy. This makes it possible for
				users to interact with computers in a more natural and intuitive
				manner. The integration of NLP into various applications has
				transformed the way we interact with technology. These
				applications include machine translation, voice assistants and
				chatbots.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cybersecurity, a critical aspect in our digital lives, has
				become increasingly important as the world becomes increasingly
				dependent on technology. The growing number of cyber attacks,
				data breaches, and other security threats shows the need for
				robust and efficient cybersecurity measures. For example there
				was a recent breach of the popular password manager LastPass.
				Many customers were initially informed that the breach was minor
				and did not affect them en mass. However it was later revealed
				that the attack was worse than expected. This leads us to the
				use of Machine Learning algorithms to detect and prevent
				cyberattacks. It is rapidly gaining popularity, and I am
				intrigued to learn about how these technologies can protect our
				digital selves from potential threats.
			</p>
			<p>
				In conclusion, I am very interested the the topics of
				Cybersecurity, Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning
				because they are the future. Cybersecurity is impotent since it
				keeps bad actors from corrupting our increasingly digital world.
				Natural Language Processing helps us communicate better with
				machines. And finally Machine Learning which help refine and
				tune machines to do harder and more complex tasks.
