					There are several ways to protect yourself online,
					including: using strong passwords, keeping software and
					security systems up to date, being cautious when clicking on

					scams. Additionally, you can use a virtual private network
					(VPN) to encrypt your internet connection and protect your
					data from being intercepted.
